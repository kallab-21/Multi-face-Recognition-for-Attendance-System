# Multi-face-Recognition-for-Attendance-System
semster project
The four phases of this system are database building, face detection, face recognition, and attendance updating. Images of the students in class are used to develop databases. The Haar-Cascade classifier and the HOR(Histogram of Oreinted Gradient ) technique are used, respectively, for face detection and face recognition. Faces are picked up and recognised in the classroom's live-streamed footage, also recognised from an image of multiple students. At the conclusion of the session, attendance will be stored in csv file.
